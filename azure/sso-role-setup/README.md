- For ClientID, click `App registrations` on side menu of active directory page and register a new app. Then copy its application / client id

- Search kumolus in search bar and add `kumolus app`
- Now click on that app and copy its application id.
- Now add this appliction ID in `get-endpoints.sh` script.

## Run scripts
- bash generate-token.sh  (for api token generation)
- bash get-endpoint.sh    (for getting sso app details)
- here in response there must be a section named `appRoles` with a json value like
  [
  {
    "allowedMemberTypes": [ "User" ], 
    "description": "msiam_access", 
    "displayName": "msiam_access", 
    "id": "8af87ca7-4582-4025-96d7-3a34d7b677ac", 
    "isEnabled": true, 
    "origin": "Application", 
    "value": null 
    }
   ]
  
- copy the id from this value and replace it in `update-roles.sh` line number 14.
- bash update-roles.sh  <id copied from previous step>  (for updating role in azure)
